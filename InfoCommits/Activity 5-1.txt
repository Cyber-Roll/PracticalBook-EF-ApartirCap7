Enhanced logging and DB schema updates

- Initialized a private `Path` variable in `LibLog.cs` and modified the `Log` class constructor to accept new parameters.
- Added `AddLine` method and updated timestamp format in `Log` class.
- Introduced new EF Core migrations to adjust column sizes/types in `Items` table, set min/max values on `Quantity`, and enable soft delete functionality.
- Created `InventoryModelsConstants.cs` for defining constants related to inventory models.
- Updated `Program.cs` to shorten the display of certain item details.
- Updated `InventoryDbContextModelSnapshot.cs` and model classes to reflect DB schema changes and enforce new constraints.

Activity 5-1 summary
This activity gave you a good look at how you can use annotations and migrations to
modify your database schema. Some of the things you learned were

• You can set the key fields for the table with the [Key] annotation.
• Making fields required is possible with the [Required] annotation.
• Use [StringLength] to set the maximum and minimum length of a string.
• Use [DefaultValue(<value>)] to set the default value of a field.
• Some of the annotations (attributes) only apply to the model state.
  In these cases, we can create a script to run T-SQL statements. This
  was highlighted with the Range attribute on the Quantity and Price
  properties.
• Use [Range] to set the minimum and maximum values of a field in the model state.
