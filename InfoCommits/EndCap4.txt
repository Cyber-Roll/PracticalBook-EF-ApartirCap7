Enhanced logging, auditing, and item management

This commit introduces significant enhancements across the application, focusing on improving logging, 
auditing, and database management capabilities. Key changes include the addition of `LibConsola.dll` 
and `LibLog` project references for advanced logging functionalities. The solution and project files
 have been updated for better organization and standardization, including adjustments to the `.sln` 
file and project type corrections.

In `Program.cs`, new constants for user IDs and methods for item management (`UpdateItems`, 
`DeleteAllItems`) have been added, alongside improvements in item listing and initialization details.
The database context and model have been adjusted to integrate `LibLog` for logging, introduce a new 
class for path management, and enhance audit trails with automatic setting of audit fields. Migrations
have been updated to reflect changes in the database schema, particularly for audit fields.

Refactoring efforts include the relocation of `ConfigurationBuilderSingleton` to the `InventoryHelpers` 
namespace, enhancing project structure and functionality. The `InventoryHelpers` project has been 
significantly updated, with new project references and the introduction of logging capabilities. 
Changes to models and migrations support expanded item details and auditing information, ensuring 
better data tracking and integrity.

Overall, these changes collectively improve the application's robustness in logging, auditing, and 
item management, while also enhancing code organization and project structure.
